description: parens dataset 10k ONLY # little description

files: # assign files to reference name
  states: states.hdf5 # HDF5 files have to end with .h5 or .hdf5 !!!
  train: train.hdf5 # word ids of training set
  words: train.dict # dict files have to end with .dict !!

word_sequence: # defines the word sequence
  file: train # HDF5 file
  path: word_ids # path to table in HDF5
  dict_file: words # dictionary to map IDs from HDF5 to words

states: # section to define which states of your model you want to look at
  file: states # HDF5 files containing the state for each position
  types: [
